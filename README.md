# Web Application Security Testing – XSS & SQL Injection

This project demonstrates hands-on ethical hacking exercises to identify and exploit **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** and **SQL Injection (SQLi)** vulnerabilities in web applications.  
The work was conducted in a controlled lab environment using industry-standard penetration testing tools – aligned with OWASP Top 10.

---

## 📌 Project Scenario
The project simulated a penetration testing engagement, where the goal was to identify and exploit client-side and server-side vulnerabilities.  
The tasks included:
- Testing web forms and input fields for XSS injection.  
- Using **Burp Suite** to intercept and manipulate traffic.  
- Automating SQL injection testing with **SQLMap**.  
- Attempting manual payload injection in forms and query strings.  
- Capturing cookies and sensitive information through crafted payloads.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Burp Suite** – Web traffic interception, payload testing.  
- **Kali Linux** – Penetration testing environment.  
- **SQLMap** – Automated SQL Injection exploitation.  
- **Chromium** – Browser for manual XSS injection tests.  

---

## 🧩 Frameworks Applied
- **OWASP Top 10 (A03:2021 Injection, A07:2021 Identification & Authentication Failures)**  
- **Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)** – For structured test execution.  
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** – Referenced for identify-protect-detect approach.
